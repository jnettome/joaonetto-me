## And Who Are You Again?

Oh hey --- I'm Michael Rose, just another boring, tattooed, time traveling, designer working in Buffalo, New York. I'm into drawing [portraits of strangers](/articles/paperfaces-ipad-portrait-project.html) on an iPad using [Paper by 53](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper), movie theater popcorn, [chicken wings done right](http://www.duffswings.com "Duff's Famous Wings"), watching dust collect on my [record collection](http://www.discogs.com/user/mmistakes/collection), and playing the occasional iOS game.

When I'm not drawing on my iPad, releasing open source [Jekyll themes]({{ site.url }}/work/jekyll-themes/), or [building web stuff](http://ekowave.com), I work as an web designer and content admin for a global lab supply company. On any given day I could be developing and designing front-ends, landing pages, email promotions and newsletters, massaging content in and out of CMS's or just getting cozy with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

And if that wasn't enough --- I'm a mediocre husband and father of [twin girls](http://2littlerosebuds.com "my 2 little rosebuds").

## What's a Made Mistakes?

So what does this all have to do with *made mistakes* and why did you name your website that? It vaguely has something to do with that whole happy accident thing, where a mistake can turn out to be something great and unplanned. But to be honest I was just looking for a short, memorable sounding domain name.

In May of 2004 I purchased mademistakes.com, and threw up a Macromedia Flash splash (hey remember those?) while I worked on building a design portfolio using Movable Type. For the next couple of years I would experiment with various content management systems ([Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) &rarr; [Textpattern](http://textpattern.com/) &rarr; [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) &rarr; [Indexhibit](http://www.indexhibit.org/)), developing minimalistic themes and learning what I could about HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and MySQL databases.

I've since decided to go CMS-free and utilize black magick and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [generate flat HTML files](/articles/2012-03-19-going-static ) for greater control and improved performance. Building all of the layouts, stylesheets, feeds, and assets from scratch has been challenging, but completely worth it.
